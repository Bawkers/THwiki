## On the Server
When you first join TownyHavens, you randomly spawn somewhere on a map of Earth. You can easily locate your position by visiting `http://townyhavens.net/map `

Gameplay on TownyHavens revolves around the popular plugin Towny, allowing players to create Towns and Nations. You are encouraged to join an existing Town, or take on the challenge of founding your own. Towns are the only method of claiming land and guaranteeing the safety of your creations.

There is no teleportation on TownyHavens, other than traveling to public towns. You may do so using the command /t spawn <town>; however, some towns may not allow outsiders to visit their spawn.

## Economy
On TownyHavens, the economy is solely based on gold ingots. The only forms of virtual currency are Town and Nation banks, which are used to store gold to purchase land. There are no forms of player-based banks or vaults, so keep your gold safe!

## Towns
### Joining an Existing Town
Creating a town takes a lot of time, gold, and effort. When you first join TownyHavens, it may be easier and more practical to join an already existing town. This option can allow you to get a head start while having the ability to create a town in the near future.

In order to join an existing town, you must receive an invite request. This can be obtained by asking the community if anyone is in need of new members. There are almost always towns happy to welcome newcomers.

### Creating a Town
Once you have accumulated 100 gold ingots, you are finally able to create a town. To create a town, use the command `/town new <town name>.` This will deduct 100 non-refundable gold ingots from your inventory.

## Nations
### Joining a Nation
Once you become a town, you are eligible for joining a nation. 

### Creating a Nation
For a town to become the capital of a new nation, they must have 1000 gold in their nation bank. Only the mayor of an existing town can form a nation. To create a nation, use the command `/nation new <nation name>.`

Nations can invite other towns that are eligible of joining a nation using the command /nation invite <town name>. When a nation falls, each town is left nation-less.

## Inactivity
Players inactive for more than 45 days will be deleted from the towny database. If there are no residents in a town, the town is deleted
