## On the Server
When you first join TownyHavens, you randomly spawn somewhere on a map of Earth. You can easily locate your position by visitng http://townyhavens.net/map 

Gameplay on TownyHavens revolves around the popular plugin Towny, allowing players to create Towns and Nations. You are encouraged to join an existing Town, or take on the challenge of founding your own. Towns are the only method of claiming land and guaranteeing the safety of your creations.

There is no teleportation on TownyHavens, other than traveling to public towns. You may do so using the command /t spawn <town>; however, some towns may not allow outsiders to visit their spawn.

## Economy
On TownyHavens, the economy is solely based on gold ingots. The only forms of virtual currency are Town and Nation banks, which are used to store gold to maintain upkeep and purchase land. There are no forms of player-based banks or vaults, so keep your gold safe!

## Towns
### Joining an Existing Town
Creating a town takes a lot of time, gold, and effort. When you first join TownyHavens, it may be easier and more practical to join an already existing town. This option can allow you to get a head start while having the ability to create a town in the near future.

In order to join an existing town, you must receive an invite request. This can be obtained by asking the community if anyone is in need of new members. There are almost always towns happy to welcome newcomers.

### Creating a Town
Once you have accumulated 100 gold ingots, you are finally able to create a town. To create a town, use the command /town new <town name>. This will deduct 100 non-refundable gold ingots from your inventory.

Every twenty-four hours, 5 gold is collected from every town and nation on the server as an upkeep cost. You must have at least 5 gold stored in your town bank when this takes place or else your town will fall into ruins. To store gold in your town bank, use /town deposit <amount>. When a town falls into ruins, all blocks built remain unprotected from outsiders.

## Nations
### Joining a Nation
Once a town recruits 3 members, they are eligible for joining a nation. 

### Creating a Nation
For a town to become the capital of a new nation, they must have at least 5 members recruited and 500 gold in their nation bank. Only the mayor of an existing town can form a nation. To create a nation, use the command /nation new <nation name>.

Similar to a town, nations also must pay a daily upkeep fee of 10 gold. To deposit gold into a nation bank, use the command /nation deposit <amount>. Nations can invite other towns that are eligible of joining a nation using the command /nation invite <town name>. When a nation falls, each town is left nation-less.
