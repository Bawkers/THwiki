## Start a Siege

To start a siege place a colored banner close to the town you want to siege. You will need 4 gold per chunk that the defending town owns and also a General or King rank to initiate the siege. The siege winner will receive this money back.  A nation may only have a siege active at a single time. This value may change in the future but at least for the release of siege war, it will remain. 

## Peaceful Towns
As a mayor, you can declare your town to be peaceful by doing `/t toggle peaceful`. PVP will be forced off in towns and residents will not be able to conflict any PVP damage.  It takes three days to confirm that towns are peaceful so that the system is not abused.

## Scoring Points
For the attacking nation to win a siege the siege score must be positive and for the defending town to win the siege score must be negative. Sieges last for 3 days and the timer can be found in `/t` for that town. 

### Banner Control 
Gaining banner control for your side contributes to siege points. This requires you to have a military rank and can be done by remaining close to the siege banner for 10 minutes. Once your side has banner control, 10 siege points will be given every 20 seconds. 

### Killing Players
Killing enemies within a 100 block radius of the siege banner contributes 100 siege point. Allies with a military rank can also contribute. All residents in the nation and allies with a military rank can contribute to the score. 

## Tactical Visibility 
Any player pillaging at the banner is always visible on the map. Other players can simply equip a compass or shield in their off-hand to disappear from the map. Other players remain visible on the map.

## Abandon Attack
After 24 hours of a siege being initiated, kings or generals can abandon the siege by placing an all-white banner around the siege banner.

## Military Ranks
Military ranks are used in siege warfare for those that contribute to sieges. The military ranks for towns are guard, sheriff, and mayor. The military ranks for nations are soldier, captain, general, and king.

## Surender Town
After 24 hours of a siege being initiated, mayors can surrender the town by placing an all-white banner somewhere in the town.

## Capturing a Town
After the siege is won, a king or general can place a colored banner in the wilderness around the town to add the town to their nation. 

## Plunder
After the siege is won, a king or general can place a chest in the wilderness around the town to plunder 2 gold per chunk, transferring the gold to the plundering nation. If the town does not have enough gold, the town will fall into ruin. 

## Ruins
When a town is deleted or falls, it will enter a ruined state for 72 hours. In this state, players can build and destroy. After 24 hours of the town being in a ruined state, it can be reclaimed using `/t reclaim`. If no one claims it after 72 hours, the town will be deleted. 

## Revolt
After 7 days of a town being captured by a nation, the town can revolt. This can be done by using `/n leave`
