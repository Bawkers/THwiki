## Start a Siege

To start a siege place a colored banner close to the town you want to siege. You will need 4 gold per chunk that the defending town owns and also a General or King rank to initiate the siege. The siege winner will receive this money back.  A nation may only have a siege active at a single time. Starting a siege will also mean that pvp will be enabled in that town. 

## Peaceful Towns
As a mayor, you can declare your town to be peaceful by doing `/t toggle peaceful`. PVP will be forced off in towns and residents will not be able to conflict any PVP damage.  It takes three days to confirm that towns are peaceful so that the system is not abused. Peaceful towns can be sieged but are protected from all material siege costs e.g. pillage, plunder, and occupier taxes. Residents also cannot have nation-military-ranks if they are peaceful. 

## Scoring Points
For the attacking nation to win a siege the siege score must be positive and for the defending town to win the siege score must be negative. Sieges last for 3 days and the timer can be found in `/t` for that town. 

### Banner Control 
Gaining banner control for your side contributes to siege points. This requires you to have a military rank and can be done by remaining close to the siege banner for 10 minutes. Once your side has banner control, 10 siege points will be given every 20 seconds. Only 6 players can hold the siege banner at once. 

### Killing Players
Killing enemies within a 100 block radius of the siege banner contributes 100 siege points. Allies with a military rank can also contribute. All residents in the nation and allies with a military rank can contribute to the score. 

## Tactical Visibility (Not currently enabled) 
Any player pillaging at the banner is always visible on the map. Other players can simply equip a compass or shield in their off-hand to disappear from the map. Other players remain visible on the map.

## Abandon Attack
After 24 hours of a siege being initiated, kings or generals can abandon the siege by placing an all-white banner around the siege banner.

## Military Ranks
Military ranks are used in siege warfare for those that contribute to sieges. The military ranks for towns are guard, sheriff, and mayor. The military ranks for nations are soldier, captain, general, and king. To give a military rank you must be king. Do `/n rank add (rank name) `

## Surender Town
After 24 hours of a siege being initiated, mayors can surrender the town by placing an all-white banner somewhere in the town.

## Capturing a Town
After the siege is won, a king or general can place a colored banner in the wilderness around the town to add the town to their nation. If the capital of a nation is taken, then the new capital is the largest town in that nation. 

## Plunder
After the siege is won, a king or general can place a chest in the wilderness around the town to plunder 4 gold per chunk, transferring the gold to the plundering nation. If the town does not have enough gold, the town will fall into ruin. 

## Ruins
When a town is deleted or falls, it will enter a ruined state for 72 hours. In this state, players can build and destroy. After 24 hours of the town being in a ruined state, it can be reclaimed using `/t reclaim`. If no one claims it after 72 hours, the town will be deleted. After a town goes to ruin, joining is disabled. So only the pre-ruin residents can reclaim that particular town. If a resident leaves the town while ruined they cannot rejoin or reclaim it.

## Revolt
After 7 days of a town being captured by a nation, the town can revolt. This can be done by using `/n leave`

## Tips
1. **Fortify towns** - Walls are important. During sieges they help stop enemies from infiltrating towns and killing residents.
2. **Fortify or abandon outposts** - Outposts are important. Towns can be besieged anywhere they have claimed territory.  Make provisions to defend valuable outposts, and abandon the rest.
3. **Assign combat ranks** - Find residents who can be trusted to fight for your town or nation, and assign them military ranks.
4. **Watch your town bank balance** - As a mayor, keep enough money in the bank for sieges. If a town is pillaged or plundered of all its gold by a siege attacker, the town will be destroyed, entering a ruined state for 3 days with all perms enabled. After 1 day it can be reclaimed by any resident, otherwise it will be deleted.
5. **Make friends & allies** - Diplomacy is critical.  As a mayor, diplomacy can be the difference between your town remaining independant, within a friendly nation, or occupied by an expansionistic empire. As a king, diplomacy can be the difference between your nation succeeding, and its annihilation.
6. **Do not remove guards while they are near sieges** - As an under-siege mayor, if one of your guards (online or offline) is near the siege banner, ensure they do not get removed as a battle participant (e.g. deranked). If this happens, a siege-point penalty will be applied.
7. **Do not remove soldiers while they are near sieges** - As an attacking/defending king, if one of your soldiers (online or offline) is near a siege banner, ensure they do not get removed as a battle participant (e.g. deranked). If this happens, a siege-point penalty will be applied.
8. **Make a plan B (Mayor)** - As mayor, defeat in battle is rarely a cause for abandoning your town. Your town may lose a little money due to plunder, or be temporarily occupied, but your buildings, items, and townspeople are the same, and still need your wise leadership to prosper.
9. **Make a plan B (King)** - As king, defeat in battle is sometimes only a temporary setback. If a town has fallen to the enemy, rally your soldiers to defend your remaining towns. If your capital is about to fall, evacuate to a (new or existing) loyal town and declare it the capital (king will change).
