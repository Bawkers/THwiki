## Start a Siege

To start a siege place a colored banner close to the town you want to siege. You will need 5 gold per plot that the defending town has and also a General or King rank to initiate the siege. The siege winner will receive this money back.

## Scoring Points
For the attacking nation to win a siege the siege score must be positive and for the defending town to win the siege score must be negative. Sieges last for 3 days and the timer can be found in /t for that town. 

### Banner Control 
Gaining banner control for your side contributes to siege points. This requires you to have a military rank and can be done by remaining close to the siege banner for 10 minutes. Once your side has banner control, 10 siege points will be given every 20 seconds. 

### Killing Players
Killing enemies within a 100 block radius of the siege banner contributes 100 siege point. Allies with a military rank can also contribute. All residents in the nation and allies with a military rank can contribute to the score. 

## Tactical Visibility 
Kings and Generals are always visible on the dynmap. Any player pillaging at the banner is always visible on the map. Other military-ranked players can simply equip a compass or shield in their off-hand to disappear from the map. Other players remain visible on the map.

## Military Ranks
Military ranks are used in siege warfare for those that contribute to sieges. The military ranks for towns are guard, sheriff, and mayor. The military ranks for nations are soldier, captain, general, and king. If a friendly military leader is nearby when a soldier dies in a siege, then points loss is reduced by 20%. If an enemy military leader is nearby when a soldier dies in a siege, then points loss is increased by 20%. If a military leader dies in a siege, then points loss in increased by 50%.
