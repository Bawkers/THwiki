# The Moon

The Moon is currently being reworked and updated. Check back here when the Moon Update comes out!

## Traveling to the Moon
Traveling to the Moon requires you to build a rocket. To build a rocket place the following in a verticle order: 

`One block of Redstone as the base, 3 blocks of Glass on top of the Redstone, and a block of Iron on top of the Glass blocks`

Once you have built the rocket, right-click the Redstone block with a coal block to activate the rocket engine. You will then be shot up into the sky and randomly teleported on the Moon. To get back to earth do /teleport or /t spawn to your town or public town. 


## Aliens
