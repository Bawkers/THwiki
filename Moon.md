# The Moon

## Bosses
The moon is littered with hostile aliens. Throughout your adventure on the moon you will see Alien workers, Alien soldiers and also Alien queens. Killing them will drop end loot including Elytras, shulker shells, end blocks and much more. It is best to hunt them with other players as they can be quite deadly. 

## Effects
You will give you special potion effects to imitate what it may be like being on the actual moon. This includes JUMPING and SLOW_FALLING effects.

## Claiming
Towny mechanics on the Moon work the same way on Earth. This means that you can also make towns, outposts and nations on the moon. Colonize the moon!
