# The Moon

## Traveling to the Moon
Traveling to the moon requires you to build a rocket. To build a rocket follow this design:

`Lower block, Redstone. 3 blocks, Glass. Top block, Iron block. `

Once you have built the rocket, right-click the Redstone block with a coal block to activate the rocket engine. You will then be shooted up into the sky and randomly teleported on the moon. To get back to earth make sure you have another rocket or can /t spawn to your town or public town. 


## Bosses
The moon is littered with hostile aliens. Throughout your adventure on the moon, you will see Alien workers, Alien soldiers and also Alien queens. Killing them will drop end loot including Elytras, shulker shells, end blocks, and much more. It is best to hunt them with other players as they can be quite deadly. 

## Effects
You will give you special potion effects to imitate what it may be like being on the actual moon. This includes JUMPING and SLOW_FALLING effects.

## Claiming
You cannot make towns or outposts on the moon.
