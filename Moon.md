# The Moon

## Traveling to the Moon
Traveling to the moon requires you to build a rocket. To build a rocket place the following in a verticle order: 

`Start by placing one block of redstone as the base. Place 3 blocks of glass on top of the redstone. Finally, place a block of iron on top of the glass blocks`

Once you have built the rocket, right-click the Redstone block with a coal block to activate the rocket engine. You will then be shooted up into the sky and randomly teleported on the moon. To get back to earth do /teleport or /t spawn to your town or public town.
